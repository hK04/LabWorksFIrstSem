# LabWorksFIrstSem
Repository meant to solve all works completed during the Course of Project works in MIPT. All results completed as latex based presentations and jupyter notebooks math source 

Repository created in colaboration with [Masov. E](https://github.com/eMasov)

[1. First work. Main point is to get used to work with Oscillographs](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/LearningHowToUseOscillograph)

[2. Second work. Main point is to get familiar with the Poisson Distribution of Discrete values and compute its on 3 gigabytes data captured from usb-oscillograph](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/CosmicRaysRadiation)

[3. Third work. This work meant to help us with concept of waves in solid matters (like in long metal bars), and task were to find Young's modulus for different types of metals](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/Young's%20modulus)
